# [Project 1: Bank Customer Churn Rate Prediction using a Artifical Neural Network](https://github.com/JMarcoOviedo/Bank_Customer_Churn-Model)

* Created visuals to analyze the customer churn rate to see which factors could affect the churn rate
* Processed and adjusted the categorical data using the Label Encoder and One Hot Encoder from Sklearn
* Standardardized the data to improve the Artificial Neural Network
* Trained the Artificial Neural Network with two hidden layers using the rectifier and sigmoid activation function 
* Created a confusion matrix to visualize the accuracy of the model

# [Project 2: Dog and Cat Image Classifier](https://github.com/JMarcoOviedo/Dog_and_Cat_Image_Classifier)

Data Science Project using Deep Learning for Image Classification

For this project, I built a Convolution Neural Network to identify whether an image was of a dog or a cat. This could be useful if Animal Control Services need to identify what kind of animal they would be dealing with. This would be more beneficial for security camera footage that may not have as high of a resolution as phone cameras. 

I was able to get the model to 84% accuracy after constructing the CNN which may be increased with additional training data.
