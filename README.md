# [Project 1: Bank Customer Churn Rate Prediction using a Artifical Neural Network](https://github.com/JMarcoOviedo/Bank_Customer_Churn-Model)

* Created visuals to analyze the customer churn rate to see which factors could affect the churn rate
* Processed and adjusted the categorical data using the Label Encoder and One Hot Encoder from Sklearn
* Standardardized the data to improve the Artificial Neural Network
* Trained the Artificial Neural Network with two hidden layers using the rectifier and sigmoid activation function 
* Created a confusion matrix to visualize the accuracy of the model

# [Project 2: Dog and Cat Image Classifier](https://github.com/JMarcoOviedo/Dog_and_Cat_Image_Classifier)

Data Science Project using Deep Learning for Image Classification

For this project, I built a Convolution Neural Network to identify whether an image was of a dog or a cat. This could be useful if Animal Control Services need to identify what kind of animal they would be dealing with. This would be more beneficial for security camera footage that may not have as high of a resolution as phone cameras. 

I was able to get the model to 84% accuracy after constructing the CNN which may be increased with additional training data.

# Group Project Statistical Reports

# [Regression Report of County Demographic Information for 440 Counties in the United States](https://github.com/JMarcoOviedo/Project-Code/blob/main/Project%20Reports/County%20Pop%20Regression.pdf)
* Created multiple regression models in R comparing active physicians to separate variables such as population or personal income
* Measured linear association of regression models
* Created residual and normality plots in R

# [Statistical Report to Determine Which Diet Provided the Most Weight Lost](https://github.com/JMarcoOviedo/Project-Code/blob/main/Project%20Reports/Diet%20Comparison.pdf)
* Created a visual representation of the data set
* Performed multiple tests to ensure ANOVA assumptions werenâ€™t violated
* Performed an F-Test and created Confidence Intervals to determine if the diets were significantly different from each other

# [Non-parametric Statistical Report Comparing Pain Relief for two Drugs](https://github.com/JMarcoOviedo/Project-Code/blob/main/Project%20Reports/Pain%20Relief%20Comparaison%20.pdf)
* Created a visual representation of the data set
* Performed a Mann-Whitney test and created a Shift Parameter Confidence Interval since outliers were present and the distribution was skewed.
