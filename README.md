# Project 1: Bank Customer Churn Rate Prediction using a Artifical Neural Network

* Created visuals to analyze the customer churn rate to see which factors could affect the churn rate
* Processed and adjusted the categorical data using the Label Encoder and One Hot Encoder from Sklearn
* Standardardized the data to improve the Artificial Neural Network
* Trained the Artificial Neural Network with two hidden layers using the rectifier and sigmoid activation function 
* Created a confusion matrix to visualize the accuracy of the model
